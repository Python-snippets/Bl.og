## Running Bl.og (locally)

### clone this repo

```
https://github.com/Python-snippets/Bl.og.git
```

### Install Django

```
pip3 install django
```

### Prepare your environment

```
python -m venv env

### Run The development server

> **_NOTE:_** Everytime you run the server, login/register a new user and create a new to do list, everything will be saved in the [db.sqlite3](./db.sqlite3) database file. Make sure not to add the `db.sqlite3` file to the your commits for public/production use. (Trust me i am guilty of it üò¢)
